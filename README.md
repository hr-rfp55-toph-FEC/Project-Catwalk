## Project Catwalk

Front End Capstone for Hack Reactor. We are from RFP-55.
The goal of this project is to update an old e-commerce website to use modern front-end technologies. We created three widgets for this newly revamped website - Product Overview, Related Products & Outfit, and Ratings & Reviews. The project utilized react hooks for more flexible development tools, and adhere to the ESlint Airbnb style.
